Styling
  1. Ways to use Styling in React Native
    - Inline Style
    - StyleSheet Objects

  2. Layouts & Flexbox
    - sample Style
      {
        flex: 1,
        flexDirection: 'column',
        justifyContent: 'flex-start',
        alignItems: 'flex-start'
      }

React Native Styling Rules
  1. borderRadius dont work in iOS
    - need to use <View> and wrap the <Text>

  2. Styles don't cascade
    - child element dont inherit the style form parents
    - each core components are stand alone


React Native Optimizations
  1. ScrollView vs FlatList
      NOTE                  - they both have same attributes to use

      - ScrollView          - renders all the items even if its not shown on the screen
                            - can cause performance issue
                            - recommended to use for limited items

      - FlatList            - only render the item that are on the screen
                            - all the items that are off the screen will only be rendered lazily
                            - recommeded for dynamic items

JavaScript Extra Infos
  1. bind()                 - used in functions
                            - allows to pre-configure a function for future execution 
                            - contains 2 parameters (this, value)
